.NET OneCore
==============

OneCore is a hardware\platform independent set of libraries that allows to work with different hardware\protocols using single implementation.
General idea is to have hardware abstraction of Network, GPIO, SPI, I2C, Pwm for platforms like .NET Micro Framework, Windows Universal Apps and Windows Phone 8.1

Protocols implementation:

* LIFX

Hardware drivers implementation:

* nRF24l01
